## Time Series Analysis
##### Here I have first studied the mathematics behind the stationarity of data and how to detect it, we can detect stationarity in data by using augmented-dickey-fuller test which is used in statisics
##### We can see the ACF and the PACF models of the non stationary data and what inference can be derived from obsereving 
##### There are many models in TSA but the basics are AR(Auto Regressive) and MA(Moving Average) models
##### Then the other model which is more widely used is the ARMA model which combined AR and MA models to check the impact of lags and residuals.
##### Then as a small project, I downloaded the active stock data and analyzed the data using ACF and PACF model, then as a basic idea - if I predict a high enough return and 
##### not holding, buy stock, this was done using ARMA model.
##### There exists more models such as SARIMA, GARCH for them the codes will be published soon.
